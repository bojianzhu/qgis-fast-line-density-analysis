A Powerful QGIS plug-in for Large-scale Geospatial Analytics

This plugin is built based on an efficient solution, called LARGE, for generating line density visualization (LDV) with non-trivial accuracy guarantees under a single machine setting. Our preliminary experiment results show that this solution can achieve up to 291.8x speedups over the state-of-the-art solutions. One research article that is based on this solution is submitted to a prestigious conference in computer science. More details (e.g., technical parts and implementation details) will be released after this article is accepted.
